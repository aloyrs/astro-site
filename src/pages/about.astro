    Hey there, I'm Aloysius, your friendly neighborhood Software Engineer! 🚀
    Currently, I'm rocking it at DXC Technology as a Java magician 🧙‍♂️. Welcome
    to my little corner of the internet where I capture all the exciting things
    I'm learning and spill a little of my personality along the way. Join me on
    this coding journey! 💻🎉
